# nyon-stream
A rather shitty script that uses webtorrent to stream nyaa videos directly to mpv.


# Demo

# usage
python3 nyaascraperpy \<search for nyaa\>
    
    
# info
### For now the script only works on Linux with dmenu and webtorrent (webtorrent-cli) installed.
It's really not hard to make it compatible with windows but i'll just let someone do it for me.
